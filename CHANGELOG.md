## [2.1.3] - 2025-12-10

### Changed
- **CLI-ONLY ARCHITECTURE**: Package is now a pure CLI wrapper matching capiscio-python.
  - Passthrough architecture - ALL commands delegated to capiscio-core binary.
  - Removed programmatic API (validators, scorers, types).
  - For programmatic usage, use `@capiscio/sdk` (coming soon).

### Added
- **`--wrapper-version`**: Display the version of the Node.js wrapper package.
- **`--wrapper-clean`**: Remove the cached capiscio-core binary (forces re-download on next run).

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `CoreValidator`, `validateAgentCard()` exports.
- **BREAKING**: Removed `A2AValidator`, `FetchHttpClient` exports.
- **BREAKING**: Removed `ValidateCommand`, `ConsoleOutput`, `JsonOutput` exports.
- **BREAKING**: Removed all TypeScript types exports.
- Removed unused dependencies: `commander`, `glob`, `inquirer`, `jose`.

## [2.1.2] - 2025-11-20

### Changed
- **PACKAGE RENAME**: The npm package has been renamed from `capiscio-cli` to **`capiscio`**.
- **REPO RENAME**: The GitHub repository has been renamed to `capiscio-node`.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-11-20

### Deprecated
- **DEPRECATION NOTICE**: Added a startup warning to inform users about the package rename to `capiscio`.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- **Binary Manager**: CLI now automatically downloads, verifies, and manages the `capiscio-core` Go binary.
- **Dependency**: The CLI requires the `capiscio-core` binary to function; managed transparently for users.

### Changed
- **ARCHITECTURE CHANGE**: The Node.js CLI is now a lightweight wrapper around the high-performance `capiscio-core` Go binary.
  - Ensures 100% consistency between CLI and Core validation logic.
  - Drastically improves performance and stability.
  - Automatically manages the binary download and updates.
- **License**: Project license changed from MIT to **Apache 2.0**.

### Removed
- **BREAKING: Removed `--conservative` flag**: The CLI no longer supports the `--conservative` mode. All validations use the unified scoring logic.

### Breaking Changes
- **Score Expectations Updated**: Test expectations for scores have changed (e.g., 85 vs 100, 96 vs 100). Update your tests accordingly.
- **Error Message Format Changed**: Error messages now use the Go binary's output format, which may differ from previous CLI output.
- **License Change**: Project license changed from MIT to Apache 2.0. Review compliance requirements.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-03
- **BREAKING: Output format changed** - Removed single "Score: X/100" in favor of three-dimensional breakdown
- **BREAKING: No backward compatibility** - Legacy scoring completely removed from codebase
- Scoring results now appear in every validation run without opt-in flags
- Console output enhanced with rich scoring visualization
- Documentation reorganized to feature scoring system prominently

### Removed
- **BREAKING: Removed legacy single score** - No more "Score: X/100" output

### Technical Details
- **1,900+ lines of new code** across 5 scoring modules
- **176 total tests passing** (9 new scoring integration tests)
- **Zero configuration required** - scoring works out of the box
- **Schema-only mode respected** - Availability scoring returns `null` when `--test-live` not used
- **Type-safe implementation** - Complete TypeScript type system for all scoring components

### Migration Guide

**Version 2.0.0 introduces breaking changes to the output format.**

#### What Changed
- **Old format**: Single "Score: X/100" after validation
- **New format**: Three-dimensional scoring breakdown with Compliance, Trust, and Availability

#### CLI Output Impact
If you're parsing CLI output:
- **Console mode**: Look for three separate score lines instead of one
- **JSON mode**: Use `result.scoringResult` object with `compliance`, `trust`, `availability` properties
- **Legacy score**: No longer available - use appropriate dimension score instead

#### Recommended Actions
1. **CI/CD pipelines**: Update scripts to parse new JSON structure
2. **Automation**: Use `--json` flag and extract `scoringResult` object
3. **Human readers**: Enjoy richer, more actionable feedback!

#### No User Impact
Since there were no users of version 1.x in production, this breaking change has zero real-world impact. The new scoring system is significantly better and provides more actionable insights than the legacy single score.
